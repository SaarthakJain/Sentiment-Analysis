This university is not as diverse as I would have liked which is a large reason for why I chose not to attend. But if you want to stay closer to home and live in the Rio Grande Valley area, then... | negative
Absolutely nothing! | negative
It is ridiculously expensive. Not impressed with the faculty and dedication to students. It is all about reputation. You can get just as good education elsewhere for half the price. They stick the... | negative
i went there in the evening and i couldn't participate in the extra curricular activities | negative
They've switched from trimesters to semesters since I went there.  Trimesters were wonderful: 10 weeks to focus on only 3 subjects.  Sadly, they've reverted to the usual semesters. | negative
Not a big sports school (does not have an impart on your time at Stonehill). | negative
nothing, communication between staff is awful | negative
Nothing is good if the credits don't transfer. | negative
It is somewhat isolated from the urban area of Boston. | negative
Currently STILL graduating students in the field of Nuclear Medicine Technology when there is no work in the field available. SHAME SHAME SHAME!!! PS.. the surrounding town of Plainfield is a drug... | negative
There is just no nightlife or fun things to do on campus; apparently there used to be, but “all the fun people graduated last spring.”  Mobile is a small, boring city and the downtown area is a... | negative
Thea teachers are unprofessional! FIDM was a waste of my money! Student housing is expensive, not that many events for the students, teachers are not professional at teaching. | negative
It's a toss between the food, the weather, the lack of things to do, the bad professors (wich there are to many of) and the poor facilities. | negative
Distance from city center and Toledo area is kind of falling apart if it hasnt allready | negative
There is very little school spirit, especially for athletics. | negative

The advisors at Assumption were the worst I've seen at any school/university.  They provided zero direction and tended to act like you were a nuisance when asking for help.| negative
The town has everything the students need, but could use some updating.  It is a college town, but if a student is looking to be in an urban area, this isn't it.| negative
This State University has a large student body. This results in large class sizes and limited on campus housing and parking. The on campus food is also just ok and probably easy to get tired of.| negative
everything is bad. the dean and the teachers| negative
The area is expensive in terms of living costs; you have to do some research to find an affordable, or decently priced, place to live. The program is a 3 year program, rather than a 2 year program...| negative
During my time at the campus was not unified Piano Row opened when I was at the LA Program. Since it was (is) a school boasting individualism and self expression.| negative
It's super easy to get stuck in studying and not interacting with people. There's a decent amount of social things to do and activities on/off campus, but you have to look to find something to do...| negative
The student body is awkward.  The faculty are awkward.  The weather is terrible unless you like an inch of ice while walking.  They have a lot of programs you need to get into after you have spent...| negative
Outdated technology. Admissions is great and honest, many other staffers are not.| negative
Buildings are in need of lots of work, the price of the school is way out of reach for all but the rich kids. They have so many rules.| negative
Some of the coursework could be more rigorous| negative
we after work students did not connect - not the school’s fault but social program could have made it better| negative
Deception concerning accreditation. They held a carrot in front of me promising me that they were seeking regional accreditation. That was a hoax. For more information, read the Wikipedia article.| negative
The campus needs some serious upgrades, yet they are putting all of the money they are raising into building a bigger campus in Mount Pleasant| negative
Dealing with the administration is bad| negative
Tuition is costly. I recommend applying early so you can be eligible for merit scholarships.| negative
The size and location are not good| negative
bad size and location.| negative
It is expensive, ranked by Forbes as the 7th most expensive in the nation in 2013. However, +90% receive financial aid and/or merit grants.| negative
Tuition fee is too much. The financial aid department helped me out quite a bit, but others may not be as unfortunate. Remember to apply early so you'll be considered for merit scholarships.| negative
Nothing is bad except the poor reputation its been given by the people who are not successful with its rigorous final exam process for the Associate of Nursing Degree.| negative
Administration is weak| negative
univesity has a lot to offer; however, they fall short when it comes to treating students fairly. Professors could care less about students and care too much about bragging on their qualifications.| negative
Football team could be better...| negative
Having to navigate your way around.  School assumes you can figure out what you need to do to graduate.| negative
The students are generally not that interested in academics.| negative
Student needs to be very independent.  The school does not babysit their students.| negative
Boring student life, Some staff/faculty are rude| negative
Name recognition could be better| negative
college is expensive| negative
It's in the city so there are homeless people, but some are nice!| negative
The worst thing about the school is that for those of us who live in southern DE, a lot of classes are not offered in our area and leads to us having to commute to Dover or further away.| negative
Alot of party areas around the school. If you are staying in it is very loud and sometimes hard to sleep.| negative
Some of the professor's don't really teach you and you have to learn on your on.| negative
It doesn't offer many scholarships to students.| negative
unsatisfactory food in the cafeteria but I mean almost every where u go to a college u kind of get the same thing:P| negative
It is growing so fast! There are different acronyms for UCF- one being Under Construction Forever. More buildings, more student housing, more things to do around campus.| negative
bad Location and career development| negative
school is far from any major city.| negative
The price is high, but that comes with every school!| negative
Old facilities but currently being updated| negative
Little to no public transportation to/from for out-of-state students| negative
Soroities are bad| negative
Smog during summer| negative
Financial Aid Department is not good | negative
The worst thing about the school is the financial aid dept. I did not have to deal with them as much as others, but in my few dealings with them it was not a favorable experience.| negative
Many of the subjects can be very difficult to grasp and the more difficult the subject the worse the professor. Most times English is not their first language.| negative
Lack of support for non-traditional students| negative
bad Students, aside from a handful of good ones.  Hardly any of them have any clue what's going on off campus. They don't read the newspaper, etc. Just ignorant.They're also generally shallow.| negative
sometime they fire some of the better teachers| negative
Location is inconvenient. The university sits on the edge of the city and there is not much to do around the area.| negative
The location of this university is on the edge of the city which isn't the most convenient spot, but that is the only really bad thing.| negative
The ridiculously cold, dry weather. Horrid for your skin and life! Nothing to do, unless you want to freeze. #StayAway| negative
The athletes (the starters) live by a different set of rules. Special privileges.| negative
Little school spirit, some members of the administration could be considered downright incompetent.| negative
The campus dorms/apartments are way overpriced, old, small, and awful.University makes all students live on campus their freshman year if you aren't from St. Louis and not living at home with your family| negative
No specific on campus jobs for international students.| negative
minimal bars| negative
Surrounding area isn't ideal| negative
EVERYTHING is bad.  The dorms are so outdated its not even funny.  The dinning hall is never open, and closes at 8 at night which makes it hard if you have night classes.  The parking is terrible.| negative
At times it sometimes felt too strict- it would occasionally feel like you were only expected to be a student and not have a life outside class and work.| negative
Financial Aid are poor. They do not give you aid until a month after classes start if you chose to go the paper check route.| negative
Very isolated from town, student housing extremely crowded, price going up much faster than other state schools, administration rude and unprofessional| negative
It is a college town, meaning there are only a handful of places on campus to go and get away from classes, unless you have a car or don't mind waiting in the cold for the bus to city.| negative
I don't like how small sorority and fraternity life are.| negative
not enough funding for student activities| negative
The atmosphere of total apathy towards the student, no kindness, no help when I needed it, the university had absolute disregard for my future success, feelings, wealth, job future, relationships.| negative
The Budget cuts, it is hard on the students and teachers.| negative
It can be sort of expensive if you do not have any grants or scholarships.| negative
fine arts is in decline here| negative
They are very money motivated.  They are focused more on this than on providing a quality education.| negative
They advertise the MFA program in Visual Studies as being a self-directed and independent program similar to an artist residency. It is not. You will be swamped with work from full time classes.| negative
bad Professors and lack of organization| negative
Too expensive, too small, not enough choices, Danish-Lutheran obsession, this college is just weird. My son is leaving this college after spring semester.| negative
This school requires that you work in groups. The worst think about this school is joining a group that has members that do not contribute.| negative
apathetic administration, poor quality of instruction, being treated like a number| negative
The music department is not good. The faculty and staff of the music department are probably some of the most disrespectful individuals that I have ever met. Don't think of going into music| negative
The hill followed by the weather is bad. More diversity on campus would be nice and sports dominate this school.| negative
Advising at this school is the worst I've ever seen, and the worst many of my classmates who are also transfers have seen. They don't really do a good job looking at what you really need....| negative
Location too far from city| negative
Instructors are excellent - very knowledgeable and passionate about their classes.  Classes are demanding, requiring a lot of reading and writing but provide an outstanding education.| negative
Library parking is poor!| negative
Really big campus; can be scary if you are a girl out alone at night.| negative
The size of the University takes some getting-used-to and the party atmosphere can sometimes get a little out of hand.| negative
Parking is poor.  There isn't a lot and they will catch you on parking tickets, but if you stay where you are supposed to be and/or live in the dorms with no car you shouldn't have a problem.| negative
Everything is bad. There tuition is way too high for the mediocre classes. They claim they are accreditated but some programs don't transfer like Engineering/Business in Master programs. Staff is unhappy.| negative
Academics are very weak...they also recruit lower performing students...| negative
the cost is vary problematic and the town has almost nothing to do.| negative
Two faced administration| negative
Academics are terrible. Most of my instructors do not have PhDs and I am in the masters program. I can't imagine what undergrad must be like here.| negative
bad residence halls, low end students, no weekend activities, no school spirit| negative
everyone goes home on the weekends. no social life.| negative
kids are not diverse. there are some that can be nice but not enough or as much to make you stay. no parking!! and all the events are in the chapel and its all prayer and worship!!| negative
There are so many bad things it is hard to choose. First off,the students are hostile...my car was broken into twice over three years here. The school facilities are in disrepair.| negative
University is unbelievably expensive, and you have to be willing to pay that price for years in the long run. Their billing office is run far more efficiently than their career services office.| negative
One of the engineering professors was so fast in lecturing that it was near impossible to keep up in the notes, yet he expected exact duplication of his derivations for the exams.| negative
too much sports not enough varity| negative
The worst thing about this university is that chapel is really crowded because there are so many students there, but they are buliding a new chapel so hopefuly this changes soon.| negative
There are two thing that I consider to be worst about this school. One is the internet connection, especially in the dorms.  The connection will stop working sometimes and goes really slow after 8....| negative
It's very cold and snows a lot.| negative
little bit expensive and need more funds| negative
The surrounding area is a quiet suburban community.| negative
As a student, I found it hard to get adequate career advising. Most of the advising and personal attention is giving to the students in the other schools (business, education, and nursing).| negative
The beautiful campus and all the different ways to get involved.| negative
College is a selective, independent, liberal arts college situated atop College Hill. Heidelberg College's mission and programs are firmly rooted in the liberal arts, with innovative coursework in...| negative
A lot of walking involved between some of the buildings.| negative
When I went, the schools administration was a joke and just shy of impossible to work with. Finding dorm space was almost impossible after your Sophomore year since they only had 1 dorm.| negative
The food served for students choosing to live on campus could definitely be improved, however it is not awful.| negative
less diversity| negative
less space between rows in lecture halls, awkwardly climbing on top of people to get to a seat is no ideal situation.| negative
Most of the dorms available to Freshmen are awful. It has a lot of traffic and there's never anywhere to park. A lot of people complain about the winters but I actually enjoy them.| negative
Lack of nightlife; have to real dig deep to find parties and fun.| negative
I didn't really like the set up of the college buildings. Everything felt a little choppy. I think the tours can be organized a little better next time to help give those visiting a better sense.| negative
The winter can get painfully cold and unfortunately lasts through most of the school year.| negative
Job placement is not what it claims, it's not recession proof, was taught subjects and software that businesses are not hiring for or interested in, school says you can go back for more studying...| negative
NOTHING IS BAD. I ACTUALLY ENJOY GOING TO THIS SCHOOL. BEING THERE CHANGES MY MOOD AND GIVES ME A FEELING OF GREATNESS.| negative
It does not offer much for those that live on campus, as it is mostly a commuter college.  It is in a small town with nothing really going on.| negative
Financial Aid Department sucks| negative
I think the worst thing about this college is really those students that come to this school with the wrong impression and an inflated sense of entitlement about their career.| negative
students often have difficulty getting entry to classes because of capitation and unwillingness of departments to add sections.  Advising system is mediocre| negative
It's a commuter school. If you commute its hard to make friends because most people huddle in little click.| negative
poor academics| negative
the curriculum is geared to counseling in social work and I feel does not address the other aspects of the field, advocating and community  planning , and policy making.| negative
With all the students, the college needs to add parking that allows for growth.| negative
In all honesty E-books are the main reason i decided to go to a different college about half way though my degree.| negative
I AM A CURRENT STUDENT, AS WELL AS, AN ALUM.  I RECEIVED MY ASSOCIATES DEGREE WITH THEM.  I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING WRONG WITH CTU.| negative
Bad things are the students, lack of things to do, surrounding city is dangerous at night, lack of school security| negative
They hype up the competencies departments like Career Development and Financial Aid, but Financial Aid will mess up your money if you're not on them constantly and Career Development is harder.| negative
majority of the professors are bad| negative
The weather can be miserable in the Summer months.| negative
The fact that some of the equipment did not work and therefore we were not trained on it.| negative
The only problem is limited parking| negative
The worse part about my school is at times, not too often, it is time one needs to wait to hear back from them when you need help.| negative
The surrounding area is not the friendliest, however the excellent security keeps the students safe.| negative
The worst thing, I would say, would be the student to teacher ratio. The classes are so big and there are so many students there that its hard to get close to your teachers.| negative
Some of the students have disruptive habits.| negative
No sports teams, Yet| negative
the shuttle routes are limited on weekends| negative
The worst thing about the College is the lack of tradition and the lack of the real culture that should flood its doors and engulf the souls of ones that attend.| negative
The price is really high.| negative
Tuition fees is high| negative
college is undervalued and undersupported financially.| negative
Managers, Educators, Education| negative
Parking - we need more lots| negative
some teachers don't give u time to turn in assignments| negative
Too much Greek Life not enough Real Life.| negative
the school work is difficult- but definitely manageable.| negative
I wish the bus ran more often.| negative
The cost is too much| negative
The College's downfall is centered around financial resources, the college isn't as wealthy as some colleges, thus they have to make tough decisions, like aesthetics.| negative
cost is high| negative
poor food and the gym.| negative
no cafateria or student facilities. Also, not a wide variety of classes to choose from. The same teachers teach different classes, so don't get on their bad side because you might have them next semester.| negative
Professors being replaced constantly with low-quality adjuncts, budget cuts ruining the school, classes will be cancelled THE WEEK BEFORE they start, ruining your four year plan.| negative
Parking is poor at certain times(very minor though)| negative
college is Isolated.  Reaching Boston is a challenge with limited shuttle service into the city.| negative
It is not as well-known as it deserves to be, and has a pretty deep winter.| negative
It is a criminal racket designed to take money from students, but has a 7% graduation rate and is not willing to promote graduating.  NWACC tampers with grades and promotes unfair testing...| negative
Some of the classes are taken through correspondence that should not be learned through the mail, such as some Math and English classes.| negative
The worst part of this school is probably the bathrooms, not all are new and most are ok but some I would not go into other than that I have no other complaints.| negative
The worst thing about this school is that there is not enough shade for the outer extremities of the campus.| negative
This school has barely any student activities. There are only a few events such as cancer walks and flag football games.| negative
Math department has to be better and they have to have more sports like softball| negative
college officials are bad, start with dysfunctional President| negative
Meal plan options are bad| negative
The worst thing about this College is the allot break times during class. I understand this is college and not high school, but i do believe that break times should be set (10 minutes...| negative
i wish the hours were longer each day, just as your getting into a subject, it is time to go home| negative
Parking is a problem| negative
There are no grades. This means that you'll do great if you're self motivated but if you need that goal of getting an A you won't have it. Lots of people get lost and unfortunately do the least...| negative
NOTHING WAS BAD TO ME EXCEPT WHEN A STUDENT SAID THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.. BUT THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING TO CHANGE THEERE EXPERIENCE. YOU MAKE YOUR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.| negative
Some of the buildings are a little old, but just adds character to your experience at the college. The college has been around 145 years what would you expect.| negative
poor Parking and social activities off campus| negative
The worst thing in the school is the RN PROGRAM!!! The people in charge of that are not well organized and they think something different every day and their planning suck!!! they are a disaster,...| negative
Almost too much to list Ill start with the fact that you can’t get a straight answer from anyone in the building. From Financial aid to enrolment no one knows how to deliver a straight answer.| negative
I find Strict Rules bad.| negative
Rude, unorganized, could care less about students.| negative
The worst thing about the campus is the wait to go through admissions office. If you are hoping to register in any classes, be prepared for a two hour wait- on a good day.| negative
MBA classes were only offered in the evenings.| negative
I would have to say the worst thing would be internet reliability.| negative
There is little to do on the weekends.| negative
Parking is an issue| negative
Parking is bad.| negative
The location is very remote. Although there were not any incidents of crime while I was in attendance.| negative
lack of choices in dining hall| negative
Financial Aid Staff/staff really don't give information asap when needed.| negative
they don't have many 4 year degrees.| negative
small school= less class options, poor Greek housing,| negative
I would have liked more in-depth advising for potential career paths and how to best prepare while in school.| negative
The student center has never really felt like the place to hang out, but they are fixing that this year with construction of a brand-new building that looks very promising for campus life!| negative
fees is too high| negative
lack facilities| negative
I CAN TELL THAT THE FACULTY AND PROFESSORS REALLY CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS BEYOND THE ACADEMICS. ALSO, I HAVE MADE SOME REALLY GREAT FRIENDS WHILE AT COLLEGE.| negative
Mediocre athletics and luckluster leadership within the administration.| negative
Everything is bad.  The admissions office is terrible!  They deliberately misinform you of their tuition fees and don't send a statement until the drop date has passed.| negative
The New School is, ironically, relatively new.  The library is essentially non-existent, and a student center is being built (expected finish: 2013).| negative
worse thing is The inability to dialogue.| negative
There isn't much to do.| negative
I find it to have very few negative aspects, yet I believe that their emailing system is a littl slower than appreciated, and quickening the reply to emails would be beneficial to all...| negative
The location is poor. There is not much around.| negative
The location may be inconvenient for some, because there is little to do off-campus if you don't have a car.| negative
The location can be a drawback. Grantham is not a college town. The College does a good job with programming and making sure there is stuff to do, and Harrisburg is only a 15 minute drive.| negative
small classes.| negative
There is a lack of athletic activities.
The range of courses offered is limited| negative
bad part is the self-designed academics and the self-governed community| negative
The university has low standards and low expectations.  If you are really intelligent, and want an academic challenge, I recommend that you go somewhere else.| negative
Costly| negative
I graduated in Computer Information Systems and applied for an IT Help Desk job with HPU....was told I did not qualify.If they consider their program that bad, then......  Enough said!!| negative
too expensive| negative
Surrounding city is not good| negative
The one thing that drives me crazy is that the girls are either really nice  or complete b******. They either come from wealthy backgrounds or poor families, and there isn't really a middle.| negative
their is pressure to love football and drink beer| negative
The social events there are kind of lame and life on campus can feel dull, but come you are 10 minutes from literally anything. The real life is off campus.| negative
rural setting| negative
Hands down: Parking. I don't know why this situation still exists when people have been complaining about it for years.| negative
sad  part is Religious formation.  SU ought to call itself and "anti-Catholic" school.| negative
town-gown relations are bad. There could be a lot more volunteer and internship opportunities if the relationship with town if more connections were made.| negative
Sometimes I find that people/organizations can get a little too morally self-righteous or intellectually self-masturbatory, but that is a risk you will probably find at any institution.| negative
If you are looking to study instrumental music, it is not the place unfortunately. The instrumental music program is very small and struggles to find new students each year. It is not very well managed.| negative
It can get kinda frat-y. A lot of rich kids go here and can make it seem very clique-y and very greek.| negative
Cost maybe an issue depending on your financial situation.| negative
Not having a full stadium is sad| negative
The neighborhood was a little dicey at the time I went there--perhaps it's better now?| negative
food is not satisfactory| negative
The registration process was a real hassle. But a lot has changed since I attended the school| negative
The worst thing the cost of the school, treatment towards certain profiles of students far as urban & conservative, bias professors.| negative
They give you false information , when they do not follow through with their end of the deal. When you try to get your transcripts , they lose everything. I have been trying to get it for 3 months...| negative
The biodegradable solo cups that they use for fountain drinks are bad .  If you put them in the fridge they really only hold up for a couple days.  Also, I hate some of the granite counter colors in the dorms...| negative
the administration lose your financial aid information...but that's just the DNA of black colleges.| negative
I think the worst thing about the school is the lack of true brotherhood amongst the student body. Like high school, you have cliques, certainly, and those lines rarely are crossed.| negative
Dining Hall is bad!| negative
Going to a small school may sometimes feel like you live in a bubble. You see many of the same people on a daily basis. The surrounding neighborhood is a little dangerous at night.| negative
It is a small university. There is not much racial diversity on the campus.| negative
Freezing cold walks to class
Scorching hot walks to class
Outdated athletic facilities
Required on-campus housing for two years
Required cafeteria food for two years| negative
The organization of the school and its classes should be considered below average for this high ranked historical school. Many students protested their rights to equal opportunity.| negative
This college is in a sububan area. the only negative fact is the tuition cost are sky high! Costs:  2009-2010 Tuition and Fees: $34,584| negative
There is so much emphasis on research at this school. No matter what science, psychology or other related class you take it is always about research.[negative]
Parking| negative
It gets real cold in Ithaca!| negative
The language barrier in the Mathematics and Engineering Departments is also bothersome| negative
sometimes it felt a bit too small| negative
They instructors in the college of education had favorites as well as favorite school disrticts. I felt discriminated against because I was an older woman from a struggling district.| negative
Considering it is a private Christian university, Palm Beach Atlantic tends to be very strict about its chapel requirements.  Also, first year students are subject to a curfew.| negative
I am a former student who was duped into believing this school could deliver on all their hype. The marketing is fantastic but that’s where it stops! I found the overpriced under delivered...| negative
football team is lousy| negative
The location of the campus -I certainly would have liked to have a great view of the Pacific Ocean| negative
the weather is troubling| negative
The cost could be more in line with it's education level.  Campus life is great, but surrounding area pulls students away easily.| negative
EVERYTHING is bad!!! The school is so unorganized.  The administration is terrible and nasty.  You ask 2 people the same question and you get 2 different answers.| negative
The pre-professional atmosphere seems to prevent some from making a genuine effort to find a field of study that they truly enjoy.| negative
It is hard to find your "niche" in this college, especially if you are not from the surrounding area.  People are not open to new students.  Also, professors show a lot of favoritism.| negative
Academic mecca.| negative
I don't enjoy Small classes, personal attention.| negative
Can be vastly heteronormative. This isn't to say that there's not a queer movement on campus. There is!| negative
the smog is a trouble| negative
I didn't like the way some of the professors sabotaged the students who were pre-med.  Suicides occurred there.| negative
Sometimes the staff can be rude.| negative
everyone goes home on the weekends, campus completely shuts down| negative
people are rude, hobos, there is a lot of division between race/ethnicity| negative
THE WORST THING FOR ME WAS THAT MY TIME THERE ENDED. (I GRADUATED.)| negative
The limited influence on the use of students money; board plans are poor, as are rooming options.| negative
Cold weather.| negative
No swimming pool on campus| negative
vegetarian cafe food is the worst, you will lose weight quickly if you dont like it and if you tolerate it you probably will gain weight due to all the high in sodium and carb foods.| negative
Not the greatest sports programs| negative
the weather SUCKS its freezing also i was so pissed as a freshman the communications prog blocked me out of the major I wanted to be in and it took forever to get my advisor to put me in the right prog.| negative
The complete lack of a sense of community which translates into lackluster school spirit and poor general attitude towards the admin. "It's not cool to like Rollins".| negative
City| negative
That it's in Ithaca--nothing to do, little culture. Just a small place to sustain a school so large. Having a richer off-campus environment would have made Cornell a lot better.| negative
If you are not in Greek life, it sucks!  Very materialistic too.| negative
Sometimes the classes offered were limited and we had to petition the main campus to get the classes we needed.| negative
The faculty and all the people here are bad.| negative
not the greatest social scene if you are out of the typical college age; not great socially if you are a night student; not a lot of interaction between other adult students; parking on campus is poor.| negative
Parking is a bit tight.| negative
Lets face it, South Dakota is not the most entertaining place for a college student.  I would suggest to make the most out of it and you will be fine.| negative
Where to begin? If you attend as a Digital Arts & Design major, you will be forced to take tons of prerequisite classes irrelevant to your major and goals. Incompetent professors teaching subjects...| negative
Academically challenging and highly competitive with little or no mentoring.| negative
Small, kind of cliquey| negative
bad Price, staff, value, education| negative
Accepts far too many students in its attempt to be the "Largest Catholic College in the Nation" (or whatever it claims)| negative
Sometimes small is too small.  Also, Oxy is rather expensive (I received a state scholarship for tuition) and can feel rather isolated if you don't have a car (I didn't).| negative
The administration is bad. Sometimes it felt like getting something done would take an act of congress. As a transfer student I had to fight to have some of my credits count.| negative
I would have to agree with the other comments when they say that the administration seem to be at times to be very rude to the students.  It really seems as if once they got you... they no longer care.| negative
The worst thing would have been the lack of social life. The School does not promote an active social life simply due to the crazy schedule.| negative
freshman and sophomore courses are often huge lectures of as many as 200 - 300 students| negative
administration sucks| negative
There isnt enough housing, parking, class selection, or common areas. The university is trying to expand by building new dorms, but they're also letting more people in. Tuition is increasing.| negative
The one thing I wished is that the campus was as developed as it is now.  The campus did not have as many dorms and it was not student friendly at the time.  I wished the campus was as beautiful as NYU's| negative
COLD!!!!!!!| negative
It's located in a horrible city.| negative
I do not like the new classes every month, amount of time spent in class, Attendance policy n The way you get roommates.| negative
Hard to find a best thing. Really investigate what you are getting into. Admission gig did not match reality.| negative
You're on your own. You study and learn on your own, and for the easier courses, that's just fine.| negative
Education, networking, campus life all poor| negative
The Faculity| negative
The environment and the staff sucks| negative
It costs a lot, and it's in upstate New York and cold a few more months of the year than some students, especially cute women would like- you know the women who go to Cal Berkley or Miami| negative
The high cost of tuition which is similar to other high ranking private liberal art  colleges and universities including surrounding schools.| negative
The curriculums are so diverse yet the students bonded from all areas.| negative
The Diversity| negative
bad point maybe transportation and having to drive in LA| negative
At the time, lack of diversity is  good.| negative
Administratively they are confused, not willing to work for the student and each department works independently, so there is no easy way to get anything done.| negative
time consuming| negative
Schools facilities cannot keep up with the growing numbers of students accepted to the college (overcrowded housing, no parking) Also-school administration cracks down on campus life.| negative
Local fraternities and extra-mural sports are disappointing.| negative
Since the 7 week classes move very quickly, this leaves students with very little time to develop their personal lives. Student life suffers at WPI| negative
practically everything is bad. Teachers are rude and teach very poorly.| negative
Very small student body.| negative
Not enough clubs/student organizations| negative
The worst thing about this school is how expensive books and classes are.| negative
no interaction with students| negative
Taking courses at a schools that is not accredited will be a complete waste of money.  99% of US colleges and universities will not accept credit hours from a non-accredited school.  Don't waste ur money...| negative
The ladies| negative
There isn't much to do outside of campus, especially in the winter.| negative
Sometimes the food can be a little less than awesome and the hours for certain facilities can be annoying.| negative

Everything sucks... The school creates division in terms of the number of females able to join those useless GLO.  The academics very bad.  I breezed through in three years because I wasn't challenged...| negative
There is a bit of separation between the Liberal Arts and Conservatory worlds. I don't think it can be avoided given the curricula, but it makes for a bit of social compartmentalization.| negative
Everything is bad. Goldey Beacom is small, nothing to do, has poor administration, and also is ghetto. Do not let people lie to you, Goldey Beacom is probably one of the worst schools on earth.| negative
Troy University  is always constructing new buildings and doing renovations. Thus often some roads are closed, and some walkways are blocked off as well.| negative
No dorms.| negative
Lack of interest in the student on the part of the professors| negative
Every student has a bad professor or two somewhere along the way. Just be sure to trust your gut and drop that course asap!| negative

The parking configuration for students sucks.| negative
Parking is hard to find| negative
The heat of South Florida| negative

The large amount of commuters sucks.| negative
The early morning classes sucks| negative

February can get to temperatures of well below zero F.| negative
I hate Individuals running daily regimental routines.| negative

Its cold, boring, full of imature kids, theres nothing to do during your free time except go to the gym, the food sucks, the party area is ghetto, no school pride.| negative
The class and financial policies seem to change constantly without warning. You are told one thing (and promised it will not change during your study) only for it to change in a few months.| negative
The admin staff are consistently uncaring and rude.  Emails and requests go unaswered, even after 2nd and 3rd followups.  They seem to be nice enough until you enroll, then they don't treat you well.| negative
I do not see a lot of diversity: American, Chinese, and few (very few!) European students.| negative
Living conditions are horrid for freshman, bullying is tolerated and excused. Asinine commuting policy and condescending res. life director. If it were up to me, my child would go elsewhere.| negative

Surrounding areas need to be updated, Mall, Enternainment, Ect.| negative
The Cafeteria-  is well below standard when it comes to service. On weekends the cafeteria charges the same ammount and has half of the options available throughout the week.| negative
The Greeks. If you don't have letters (aka a GDI), then you're basicly not worth anyhthing. New pledges even get in trouble if they are caught talking to a non greek in a 'party' setting.| negative
The food is very bad| negative
It does not have enough sport facilities| negative
Off campus life is minimal... The town of Northfield is quant and theirs little to do besides grabbing something quick to eat.| negative
Back in the 80's we had lots of red mud everywhere....| negative
The housing!  Students get penalized for going abroad in their junior year and get very, very awful housing.| negative
Lack of communication| negative

Facilities and Sports Teams are nothing to write home about.| negative
Cold winters.| negative
Not easy to get an internship, not as much financial aid as lower ranked UCs, crowded classes without seats, walking down the street is like playing Frogger on Hard with the bicycles.| negative

The price:(| negative

The cost of attendance| negative
Did not have an MBA for Masters in the Adult studies program| negative
The school does not care about its students. They will inconvenience you at the drop of a hat and they make NO apologies for it. The Dean of Nursing often chooses not to address student concerns...| negative

The parking I would say is the only complaint I have since it is very limited.| negative
There are some lazy professors or instructors.| negative
The worst thing about my school is its location. It is located in a not so safe neighborhood so it is vital that you walk in groups.| negative

Parking! You have to give yourself an hour in advance to make it to class on time if you drive.| negative
No student union| negative

better facilities| negative
16 miles to the nearest McDonalds. 30 to Walmart. 40 to Anything else.| negative

The worst thing about Norwich was the coping from day to day....combining the military lifestyle with academic lifestyle from day to day. It could be extremely challenging.| negative
The worst is walking across the campus in a cold biting wind.  Academically, that you can not get an advanced degree, just a BA/BS. 'Went to cambridge for my MEd to teach .| negative

Sometimes, it was hard to find a parking spot!| negative
surrounding area parking| negative
Hypocrite professors.| negative

It has unutilized potential as an academic source| negative
Lacks commitment to Tradition. Ever willing to concede tradition for enrollment numbers| negative
