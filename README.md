Sentiment-Analysis
==================

A Machine Learning based sentiment analyzer.

Given the vast amount of unstructured information available online today, there is much to be gained from the development of automated systems that can effectively organize and classify this data, so that it can be leveraged by human users in a meaningful way. While it can be useful to categorize this kind of information according to its subject matter, classifying it according to the authors’ opinions, or sentiment, can also provide researchers, business leaders, and policy-makers with valuable information ranging from rates of customer satisfaction to public opinion trends. Sentiment analysis has drawn great interest in recent years because of the surge of subjective content (blog posts, movie and restaurant reviews, etc.) being created and shared by Internet users, and the scope of new applications enabled by understanding the sentiments embedded in that content. For example, extracting the sentiment of a review can help provide succinct summaries to readers, and can be very useful in automatically generating recommendations for users.
